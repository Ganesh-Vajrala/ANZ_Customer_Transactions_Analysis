# ANZ Customer Transactions Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer transactions for bank marketing campaigns using the ANZ dataset. The analysis is performed using Databricks and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen 2). The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and improve the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
## Technologies Used
**Databricks:** A unified analytics platform that provides an interactive workspace for data engineers, data scientists, and business analysts.\
**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen 2):** A scalable and secure data lake for high-performance analytics workloads.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the ANZ dataset, which contains detailed information about customer transactions, including transaction dates, amounts, and types.
